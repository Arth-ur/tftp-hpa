This is tftp-hpa-0.22, a conglomerate of a number of versions of the
BSD TFTP code, changed around to port to a whole collection of
operating systems.  The goal is to work on any reasonably modern Unix
with sockets.

The tftp-hpa series is maintained by H. Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com>.

The latest version of this collection can be found at:

    ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/tftp/

This software can be discussed on the SYSLINUX mailing list.  To
subscribe, send a message containing the word "subscribe" in the body
to <syslinux-request@linux.kernel.org>.

Please note that my main focus in this work is the tftpd
server. Although a tftp client is included, it is by and large the
stock OpenBSD version, with a small handful of portability
improvements.

Please see the INSTALL and INSTALL.tftp files for compilation and
installation instructions.

===> IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM ANOTHER TFTP SERVER, OR FROM
===> A VERSION OF TFTP-HPA OLDER THAN 0.17 SEE THE FILE
===> "README.security" FOR IMPORTANT SECURITY CHANGES!
