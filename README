This is tftp-hpa-0.12; this version was put out by H. Peter Anvin
<hpa@zytor.com>.

This is a conglomerate of a number of versions of the BSD TFTP code,
ported to Linux, although it should work on mostly any POSIX-compliant
OS with sockets.

The core software was taken from OpenBSD (CVS source as of
1999-09-21).  I believe this was the most secure source base available
at the time I obtained this code, and it included support for the -s
and -c options.

The un-BSD-ized Makefiles and a lot of the configure macros were taken
from netkit-tftp-0.10 by David Holland; I also followed this example
and modernized the code style throughout.

Patches by Markus Gutschke and Gero Kuhlmann were the basis for the
option negotiation as well as the "blksize" and "tsize" option
support, although I made a fair amount of mostly stylistic changes to
their code.

Adding the -r option (disable a specific option), the "timeout"
option, and converting to using autoconf for setup was my own code, as
are any bugs introduced in this merge.
